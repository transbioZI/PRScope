	abstract = {Understanding the genetic architecture of schizophrenia (SCZ) is invaluable for the development of personalized treatment. In three independent cohorts, using an automated pipeline, we calculated 413 psychiatry-relevant polygenic scores. Using these scores, machine learning was applied to stratify SCZ patients into two biotypes in FinnGen (nSCZ=7486), and to validate these results in the PsyCourse Study (nSCZ=421) and Bari (nSCZ=531). While the two biotypes showed comparable polygenic SCZ risk, they were primarily distinguished by a greater predisposition for neuroticism, depression-related traits, and lower cognitive performance in Biotype 1. The genetic prediction of Biotype 1 was phenotypically characterized by an increased prevalence of SCZ and a more severe and complex clinical manifestation. This illustrates that the penetrance of genetic SCZ risk might partially depend on the predisposition for the aforementioned traits through pleiotropic variants. Our results provide novel, replicable insights into the genetic architecture of SCZ and might inform future personalized treatments.Competing Interest StatementGiuseppe Blasi has received lecture and consultant fees by Lundbeck.

FinnGen was approved by the Coordinating Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS), and patients and control subjects provided informed consent for biobank research, based on the Finnish Biobank Act. Bari Protocols and procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Bari Aldo Moro. PsyCourse project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Goettingen. Some clinical centers were teaching hospitals of the University Medical Center Goettingen, and were thus covered by this initial approval. For those clinical sites that were not covered, additional approval from the respective Ethics Committees were obtained. For all centers, these were (clinical centers in parentheses): Ethics Committees of the University Medical Center Goettingen (UMG Goettingen, Bad Zwischenahn, Eschwege, Asklepios Specialized Hospital Goettingen, Hildesheim, Lueneburg, Liebenburg, Osnabrueck, Rotenburg, Tiefenbrunn, Wilhemshaven), Medical Faculty of the LMU Munich (Munich and Augsburg), Medical Faculty of the RU Bochum (Bochum), Medical Association Bremen (Bremen Ost), Medical University of Graz (Graz), Ulm University (Guenzburg) and Medical Association Westfalen-Lippe and Medical Faculty University of Muenster (Muenster).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).YesI have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines, such as any relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material, if applicable.YesFor FinnGen, researchers can apply for health data from the Finnish Data Authority Findata (https://findata.fi/en/permits/) and individual-level genotype data available through the Fingenious portal (https://site.fingenious.fi/en/). These resources are hosted by the Finnish Biobank Cooperative FINBB (https://finbb.fi/en/). Access can only be provided for research projects within the scope of the Finnish Biobank Act, which includes health promotion, understanding disease mechanisms or developing medical products or treatment practices. PsyCourse data is available to bona fide reseachers upon a submission and approval of a research proposal. Individual genotype and clinical data from the University of Bari Aldo Moro with demographic and behavioral characteristics cannot be shared at individual level in raw format because of ethic restrictions. http://www.psycourse.de/openscience-de.html https://docs.finngen.fi/},
